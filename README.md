Usually, we are advised to write down every idea before it's gone. My ideas hop impatiently through my mind until I put them into place. I am fascinated by space and time, words and numbers, metaphysics and robotics. My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.

Sarah Hart, Professor of Mathematics and the first woman Professor of Geometry at Gresham College London, ended her book "Once Upon a Prime: The Wondrous Connections Between Mathematics and Literature" with the sentence: "In literature, as in life, there are as many different ways to be a mathematician as there are different ways to be a person." This is a good evidence for my work and the point where my broad range of interests meet.

The programming language I use is Python for Data Scientists which code is fast and compact.
